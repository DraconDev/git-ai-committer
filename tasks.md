- [ ] Are version bumping related ai commits fixed now?
  - [ ] if not lets fix it
- [ ] add other providers to the list of providers, like least openai, anthropic,

## Done

- [x] currently version bumping does work perfectly it does not cause extra commits but ai keeps making commits such as feat update 1 files, or i am not even sure it's the version bumper but we might default to this if ai fails to make a commit message?
  - [x] refers to commit history.txt
- [x] It only stopped in my example because i turned off version bumping
- [x] have backup ais for commits?
  - [x] lets have 2 backup ais for commits
