# Tasks

## Do

- one clarification that we don't only version bump the package.json but whatever version system the current project uses, so we support many languages pay attention to this
- also should we ban more life patterns like *.vscode?

## Done

-   when we open the settings with the gear icon we only see an old settings page, we should see the new settings page, and get rid of the old one
-   amazing but out api configuration section is huge, is there a way to perhaps handle it better, this is only going to get worse the more we add,
-   the settings panel looks off when i switch between providers i still can only set gemini api key, also we should be able to set keys in one section and in another set priority, where we set primary secondary tertiary
-   the timing and behavior should be able to support much longer delay times, so slider is good but also have an input field for exact delay time,
-   our ignored file patters is empty now, i used to have a list, make sure that we use it and auto fill it our list of ignored files
-   we should be able to set which provider is primary and which is backup 1 and which is backup 2
-   Are version bumping related ai commits fixed now?
    -   if not lets fix it
-   add other providers to the list of providers, like least openai, anthropic,
-   currently version bumping does work perfectly it does not cause extra commits but ai keeps making commits such as feat update 1 files, or i am not even sure it's the version bumper but we might default to this if ai fails to make a commit message?
    -   refers to commit history.txt
-   It only stopped in my example because i turned off version bumping
-   have backup ais for commits?
    -   lets have 2 backup ais for commits
-   lets also rename github copilot to just editor built in ai option
-   update the read me after this is done
