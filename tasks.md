### Version Bumping

currently version bumping does work perfectly it does not cause extra commits but ai keeps making commits such as feat update 1 files, or i am not even sure it's the version bumper but we might default to this if ai fails to make a commit message?

refers to commit history.txt

###

It only stopped in my example because i turned off version bumping

###

lets have 2 backup ais for commits

###

lets also rename github copilot to just editor built in ai option

###

update the read me after this is done
